# Linkedin Connect
## Introduction
This simple python script will save you from individually clicking lots of LinkedIn URLs in situations where you want to connect to multiple people at once. 

## Instructions

1. To authenticate into LinkedIn, make a text file with the name "credentials.txt" without the quotes. First line of this file should be the email address you use to login to LinkedIn. Second line of this file should be the password associated.
```bash
emailaddress@host.com
password
```
2. Make a text file in the same directory with the name "linkedin_contacts.txt" without the quotes. The file should be a list of LinkedIn URLs one on each line like this:
```bash
https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaleab-gebremichael/
https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaleab-gebremichael/
https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaleab-gebremichael/
```
3. Run the python script, sit back and watch it do its thing
